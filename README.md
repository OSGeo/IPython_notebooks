###IPython Notebooks###

In this repository are stored a set of [IPython notebooks]() to demostrate the use of open source geospatial tools.
The ```OSGeo-live``` directory host notebooks that can be executed on the OSGeo live project. 
Other IPython Notebooks, running open source tools not installed on the live will be stored in the current directory.
