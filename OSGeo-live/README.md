###OSGeo-live###
This directory host a set of notebooks that are used in the OSGeo-live project to demostrate usage and capabilities of Open Source Geospatial Tools installed on the OSGeo Live.
To start the IPython Notebook server on the OSGeo-live, use the GEOSPATIAL menu *start ipython notebook*. 
To access to the server select in the same menu *ipython notebook* this will start a browser pointing to the IPython Notebook dashboard running on ```htpp://localhost:12345/``` .

From the OSGeo live you can upgrade to the latest version of this repository running the command ```git pull``` from the notebook directory : ```/home/user/ipython/notebooks``` or directly from inside an IPython notebook with ```!git pull``` from the notebook directory.
