    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This set of digital notebooks was created to explore several open source solutions for geospatial data analysis, with the aim of bridging together the several software libraries already installed on OSGeo live to perform complex *geo-data-science workflows*. It was originally started as a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks are developed in the [Jupyter notebook server](https://jupyter.org/) environment, which is heavily based on the [IPython](http://ipython.org/) project. They are written in different languages (bash, Python, R) and are organized in a series of \"topic-oriented\" geospatial notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete description of each project installed on OSGeo-Live refer to the [OSGeo-Live documentation](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/index.html). This work will focus on different aspects:\n",
    " * The usage of several scientific Python libraries like [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)\n",
    " * The usage of GFOSS (Geographic Free and Open Source Software) projects like [GRASS](https://grass.osgeo.org/), [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/), [OSSIM](https://trac.osgeo.org/ossim/), [mapserver](http://mapserver.org/) \n",
    " * And finally introducing more specialized software like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) for geostatistic analyses and [postgis](http://postgis.net/) as geospatial relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The geospatial notebook here developed will make use of the sample dataset pre-installed on OSGeo-Live:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Natural Earth](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/overview/naturalearth_overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [OSGeo North Carolina, USA Educational dataset](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/overview/nc_dataset_overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [OpenStreetMap](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/overview/osm_dataset_overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NetCDF Data Set](http://localhost/osgeolive/en/overview/netcdf_dataset_overview.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The geospatial notebook here are composed of 6 different sections with the aim of introducing some of the several geospatial libraries installed on OSGeo-Live. The geospatial notebooks will walk the user from simple usage of command line tools such GDAL, PROJ and OSSIM to basic SQL query on how to access database information to more complex geoprocessing including raw data parsing, numerical processing and the use of complete GIS platfom like GRASS GIS.\n",
