    "\n",
    "### From Jupyter Notebook on the OSGeo-Live\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the live, from the geospatial menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "* spatial tools -> start jupyter notebook\n",
    "* spatial tools -> jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using only GRASS GIS\n",
    "\n",
    "Start GRASS GIS on you computer. Browse through IPython Notebooks as rendered on GitHub.\n",
    "To do this you just need to click on one of the files with the suffix `.ipynb`.\n",
    "In GRASS GIS in *Layer Manager* window, select *Python shell* in the bottom\n",
    "to get an interactive Python console where you can input, edit and run the examples.\n",
    "You may want to make the window bigger to have more space for the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Jupyter and Git from a GRASS session\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the directory where you want to work and clone this\n",
    "repository (unless you already downloaded a copy):\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone git@github.com:wenzeslaus/python-grass-addon.git\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the repository directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd python-grass-addon\n",
    "\n",
    "Start GRASS GIS, from command line, using the North Carolina sample dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "    grass7\n",
    "\n",
    "Run (supposing that you are already in a GRASS GIS session) on command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get a website in a web browser where you can select individual Notebooks,\n",
    "edit and run the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "GRASS GIS is a leading software in analysis of geodata, it offers more than 400 modules in its core version plus many addons (i.e., user contributed modules). But what if the tool you are looking for is not present in GRASS GIS? So, simply create your own, we will show you how to do that in this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GRASS GIS 7, Python is the default language for creating addons. There are two main Python libraries included in GRASS GIS. Python Scripting Library allows you to perform analysis and compute new data by chaining existing modules to create your own workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "With PyGRASS library wrapping the C functions, you can create new data sets (vector and raster) directly through Python calls, increasing considerably the power and performance of your scripts. You can conveniently mix both GRASS Python libraries with other Python libraries like NumPy, or SciPy. In this workshop, we will guide you through the basic steps of writing your own Python scripts, starting with calling and chaining GRASS GIS modules, followed by a more pythonic experience when using PyGRASS to access and modify your data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then upgrade your script into an addon by defining a simple interface to enable automatically generated GUI. The next part of workshop will look into more advanced usage of GRASS GIS 7 capabilities, including Python spatio-temporal API to handle time series in your addons, creating your own toolbox with your newly developed addons and finally, introducing the new testing framework you should use as a responsible person to make sure your addons are in great shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if we won't cover all the topics during the workshop, all materials will be accessible online and GRASS GIS community is always prepared to answer your questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants should have basic knowledge of GIS, basic knowledge of GRASS GIS and basic knowledge of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set up a server\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: this step can be if skipped if running this tutorial on the OSGeo-Live 9.5\n",
    "\n",
    "When organizing a workshop, it might be advantageous to use a server with IPython Notebook\n",
    "rather then setting up the environment on participant's computers. When IPython Notebook\n",
    "is used on a server, participants will need only a browser. All server-side work is easy\n",
    "to do thanks to Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "    mkdir workdir\n",
    "    cd workdir\n",
    "\n",
    "    wget http://grass.osgeo.org/sampledata/north_carolina/nc_basic_spm_grass7.tar.gz\n",
    "    wget https://github.com/wenzeslaus/python-grass-addon/archive/master.tar.gz\n",
    "\n",
    "    tar xvf nc_basic_spm_grass7.tar.gz\n",
    "    tar xvf master.tar.gz\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can get the basic GRASS GIS image. Note that if you user does not have permissions\n",
    "to use docker (the usual defaut), you have to prefix the `docker` command with `sudo`. The same applies for scripts used futher on which are using the `docker` command. If you already have the image, you can skip this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker build github.com/wenzeslaus/grass-gis-docker\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the image and containers we need some files from this repository (we got its content in previous steps). We use `mv` because we don't need those files to be compied to the containers later.\n",
    "\n",
    "    mv python-grass-addon-master/Dockerfile .\n",
    "    mv python-grass-addon-master/run_containers.sh .\n",
    "    mv python-grass-addon-master/command_containers.sh .\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a Docker image with sample dataset and Notebooks. If you are using your image for GRASS GIS (see above), be sure you have the right image name in the Dockerfile (used by following command).\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker build -t wenzeslaus/python-grass-addon .\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file with users you want to create an container for. The file must contain\n",
    "emails at the beginning of each line (it can be for example CSV, double quote at the beginning\n",
    "is ignored).\n",
    "\n",
    "    john@university.edu\n",
    "    jsmith@example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can start:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ./run_containers.sh workshop_atendees.txt 9000\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can just specify number of conatiners you want to create:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ./run_containers.sh 15 9000\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you list of URLs and passwords with associated usernames. Usernames are\n",
    "used only to keep track of containers and to distribute the credentials. Note that\n",
    "the atendees will have to get through \"untrusted connection\" dialog in their browsers\n",
    "because the certificate used is self-signed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above command will also create a file named `containers_workshop_atendees.txt`\n",
    "(or `containers_dateandtime.txt`) with names of conatiners.\n",
    "For further actions, if they are simple enough,\n",
    "you can use a prepared script. For example, to get rid of the containers use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ./command_conatiners.sh stop containers_workshop_atendees.txt\n",
    "    ./command_conatiners.sh rm containers_workshop_atendees.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions for participants when IPython Notebook server is used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: this step can be if skipped if running this tutorial on the OSGeo-Live 9.5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You have obtained URL which looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    https://fatra.cnr.ncsu.edu:9503\n",
    "\n",
    "Type it precisely to the web browser including the *s* at the end of\n",
    "`https`, note also that port number is specified (the number at the end\n",
    "separated from domain by a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "You browser will warn you about invalid security certificate. In this\n",
    "case, you can safely add security exception. The reason for\n",
    "the message is that the certificate is self-signed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, enter the password you were provided with. Then you should\n",
    "see a list of notebooks as displayed by IPython Notebook.\n",
